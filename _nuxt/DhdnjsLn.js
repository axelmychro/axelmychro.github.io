I prefer learning by making — small ideas, quick iterations, and shipping whatever survives my perfectionism. Vue and Nuxt feel like home to me, so most of my experiments live there."}}},philosophy:{description:{t:0,b:{t:2,i:[{t:3}],s:"I believe the best interfaces are honest. Sharp lines, clear hierarchy, motion that feels intentional but never noisy — design that respects attention instead of begging for it. My approach is simple: remove what doesn't matter, refine what remains, and let the visuals tell the mood without overexplaining."}}},style:{description:{t:0,b:{t:2,i:[{t:3}],s:"Here are some colours and references that inspired me."}}}},timeline:{},contact:{}}};export{e as default};
