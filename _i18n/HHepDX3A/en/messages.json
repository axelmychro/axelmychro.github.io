I prefer learning by making — small ideas, quick iterations, and shipping whatever survives my perfectionism. Vue and Nuxt feel like home to me, so most of my experiments live there."},"philosophy":{"description":"I believe the best interfaces are honest. Sharp lines, clear hierarchy, motion that feels intentional but never noisy — design that respects attention instead of begging for it. My approach is simple: remove what doesn't matter, refine what remains, and let the visuals tell the mood without overexplaining."},"style":{"description":"My aesthetic pulls from modern web minimalism, Japanese typography energy, and a bit of gritty moodboard chaos. I like strong contrasts, tight grids, and layouts that feel deliberate rather than soft and rounded. If it looks like it belongs on a clean poster or an underground zine, it probably fits my style."}},"timeline":{},"contact":{}}}}
